This portfolio was built using TypeScript, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/). UX/ UI was built to utilize both desktop and mobile views while allowing the user to easily traverse the information. Animations were created using the [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com) react library.
